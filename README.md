# SimplestMachineLearning
Basically, the simplest possible program that still technically counts as "machine learning".
The program takes one data set, split into two arrays - features and labels - and uses gradient descent to find the line of best fit (linear regression.)
The program is only 23 lines of actual code, and involves no imported libraries.
